There are two web pages(West_late.php and index.php) in this small site.
When a visitor visits either of the two pages, the visiting time, browser the visitor is using, visitor's ip, 
and the page from which the visitor is sent to this small site are recorded in MySQL on the server.
The display_visits.php can be used to display the detailed information about the site traffic distribution
during different time.
